# OOP Examples in Python

This repository is a collection of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples in Python, created specifically for the students of **PCPS, Kupondole**. These examples are designed for educational purposes to help beginners and students understand the core concepts of OOP in a clear and practical way.

## Purpose

- **Educational Resource**: Made for PCPS, Kupondole students.
- **Beginner Friendly**: All examples are well-commented and easy to follow.
- **Demonstrates OOP Principles**: Covers abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## File Overview

### 1. `oop_example.py`

A robust, professional example inspired by property management systems (like Airbnb). Demonstrates advanced OOP concepts such as abstract base classes, inheritance, and theme compatibility. Includes classes for different property types and a manager to handle them.

### 2. `oop_animals_example.py`

Models an animal hierarchy (Dog, Cat, etc.) to show inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism in a relatable way. Includes a theme system and an animal shelter manager. Great for understanding how OOP can be used to represent real-world relationships.

### 3. `oop_simple_example.py`

A very simple and beginner-friendly example that models a basic `Car` class. Demonstrates object creation, attributes, and methods with clear comments. Perfect for those new to OOP and Python.

## How to Use

Each Python file is standalone and can be run directly. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

Replace `<filename>` with the file you want to run (e.g., `oop_simple_example.py`).
